# CMPT 732 Final Project: Trends in Song Popularity from Global Phenomena

Welcome to our repository! Our project is an exploration of recent trends in song popularity based on global phenomena.

## Instructions to run our project

Please see [`RUNNING.md`](RUNNING.md).

## Final Report

Please see [`report.pdf`](report.pdf).

## Pre-ETL Data

All the raw data about economic factors and happiness scores can be found in the [pre-etl_data](pre-etl_data) directory, which contains:

- **[`gdp_per_capita`](pre-etl_data/gdp_per_capita) directory**: Contains an Excel file for each country that contains their annual GDP per capita in USD (source: [Statista](https://www.statista.com/)).
- **[`inflation`](pre-etl_data/inflation) directory**: Contains an Excel file for each country that contains their annual inflation rate (source: [Statista](https://www.statista.com/)).
- **[`unemployment`](pre-etl_data/unemployment) directory**: Contains an Excel file for each country that contains their annual unemployment rate (source: [Statista](https://www.statista.com/)).
- **[`happiness.xls`](pre-etl_data/happiness.xls)**: An Excel file that contains the annual happiness scores out of 10 for each country (source: [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/data/)).

**Note**: There are two datasets for Spotify tracks which are too big for GitHub and must be downloaded from Kaggle:
- **[`Song Dataset`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jfreyberg/spotify-chart-data)**: Database with details about top songs in each country per week in each year.
- **[`Lyrics Dataset`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlosgdcj/genius-song-lyrics-with-language-information)**: Database with some lyrics from the Genius website.


## [Language & Lyrics Data](cleaned_data/languages_and_mood/parquet_by_lan)

We use the [Genius API](https://docs.genius.com/) to grab songs with lyrics.

Then, we use two language libraries in Python to detect the language of the lyrics: [`langdetect`](https://pypi.org/project/langdetect/) and [`pycld2`](https://pypi.org/project/pycld2/)by using [language_etl](ETL/language_etl)


## Sentiment Analysis
We use [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) models to predict the mood of our lyrics, by separating them into three categories.
All the related code in this [directory](sentiment_analysis_code) is to run the sentiment analysis portion of our project and store in [`moods data`](cleaned_data/languages_and_mood/moods_data).

## PowerBI Visualization

We also have a [PowerBI dashboard](<BI dashboard/Visualization.pbix>) to show what we found based on our cleaned data.
You can download the file and upload it to your [SFU PowerBI workspace](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/list?experience=power-bi&clientSideAuth=0) to view and interact with it.
